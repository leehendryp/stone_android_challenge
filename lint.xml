One of the classes in the Bouncy Castle library (which handles all the actual crypto for JPGPJ)
uses a standard J2SE package (javax.naming.directory) that's not included in Android. Fortunately,
this class (X509LDAPCertStoreSpi) isn't PGP-related, so the runtime won't try to load it during
normal JPGPJ use.
